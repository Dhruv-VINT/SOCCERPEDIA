            Ettore Bugatti followed his passion to create perfect automobiles ever since he created his first engineering composition at the age of 17 years old in 1898. In 1909 Ettore forever changed the world of car manufacturing when he decided to create his own path and own legend. He turned engineering into a form of art and strived for perfection on all levels like no one else. In Molsheim he set the foundation of one of the world’s most astonishing brands. It is the home of BUGATTI and where Ettore became “Le Patron”. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Celebrating a rich and unparalleled 110 year history in 2019, we proudly look back while embracing an even more exciting future whilst continuously living the spirit of Ettore.

            Mirroring the CHIRON´s exterior signature line, the LED illumination in the distinctive C-line form separates the two seats, and reveals the stunning functional beauty of the interior. The cockpit layout of the CHIRON gives the pilot all the necessary information within his range of vision. Proudly displaying the magic 500 km/h mark, the mechanical speedometer is a feast for the eyes. On the central console, milled from a single piece of solid aluminum, each unit has independent, adjustable displays.

            To reach its unprecedented levels of performance, the CHIRON effortlessly merges its captivating beauty with sleek, muscular efficiency; a spectacular reinterpretation of the BUGATTI design DNA. The intelligent air intake management significantly improves aerodynamics and enhances the cooling efficiency for engine and brakes.

            <br>
            The distinctive quad LED headlights, for example, also serve as intakes routing air to the front brakes – and thus work as a remarkable example of functionality fusing with aesthetics. This enthusiasm for performance-oriented design continues in the interior, complemented by BUGATTI’s exquisite sense of comfort and luxury.

            The heart of the CHIRON is its quad-turbocharged 8 l W16 engine. This unique masterpiece generates an incredible 1,500 hp and 1,600 Nm of torque, with an almost linear power output between 2,000 and 6,000 rpm. Four high-performing turbochargers work in a two-stage controlled configuration, and define this champion of performance. A remarkable 60,000 litres of air are pumped through the engine every minute.

            <br>
            

Simultaneously, 800 litres of water per minute circulate through the CHIRON’s heart, and guarantee the cooling of the engine and generate the extraordinary power. The new titanium exhaust system, with reduced gas back pressure, boosts this performance further. To maximise the CHIRON’s engine power, lightweight materials, such as titan and carbon fibre, have been used wherever possible.
